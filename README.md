## Frontend Tests
To obtain the front-end test results, run:
```bash
./frontend/restaurant-app-react/node_modules/.bin/jest
```

## Backend Tests

We recommend creating a new environment to avoid any unforseen issues.

To install the dependencies, run in ```/backend/src```:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To obtain the statement coverage, run in ```/backend/src```:
```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover tests
coverage html
```

To obtain the branch coverage, run in ```/backend/src```:
```bash
coverage run --branch -m unittest discover tests
coverage html
```

The respective HTML file will be called index.html and will be in the newly created htmlcov folder.
